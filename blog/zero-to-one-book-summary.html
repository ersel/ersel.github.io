			<p>Thanks to Jahan Zahid for letting me borrow his copy over the first few weeks that I joined Indigo in London. Yet short, this book delivers wealth of wisdom regarding what works and what does not work at startups. I was able to see many parallels between what Peter Thiel advocates and my adventure in the world of startups so far. Here is a short summary of the book along with some notes and commentary.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1-the-challenge-of-the-future">Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future</h1>
<p>Peter Thiel splits <em>progress</em> into two distinct forms.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal Progress</strong> is when small incremental progress is made in a field. In terms of economic activity, companies which follow this pattern simply copy things that work. Thiel calls this pattern <strong>one to many.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copying things that work, going from one to many</p>
<p><em>1 -&gt; n</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vertical Progress</strong> is when dimension shifting progress is achieved in a field. If you&#39;re familiar with Andy Grove&#39;s terminology, this is like a 10x effect. A progress which gives the company behind it a unique competitive advantage. Vertical progress can be achieved either by inventing something completely new, or by tremendous unusual improvement in a field. Thiel calls this pattern <strong>Zero to One.</strong> As the title of the book suggests, future is built through Zero to One type of progress, much like the moment of divine creation or Big Bang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inventing new things, going from Zero to One</p>
<p>0 -&gt; 1</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="chapter-2-party-like-it-s-1999">Chapter 2: Party Like It&#39;s 1999</h1>
<p>This chapter focuses on the psychology of both the entrepreneurs and investors behind dot com bubble in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>During the dot com mania, dozens of launch parties were held every week in San Francisco. There was an abundance of money in the valley along with exuberant often sketchy people chasing it. Appending <em>.com</em> to your company name increased valuation by half overnight. If the folly of so called smart money was not enough, public markets didn&#39;t know any better either. Dot com companies&#39; losses increased as they grew. Defying all laws of logic, public investors still kept throwing money at such companies further inflating their share prices. Music was loud and drinks aplenty, there was no need to be concerned, party was going strong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.</p>
<p>- Nietzche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March 2000, NASDAQ reached its peak at 5,048. In 3 weeks time it fell to 3,321 and in October 2002 it fell to the bottom of 3,321. Party was over.</p>
<p>4 main learnings taken by entrepreneurs and investors from this event were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Incremental changes are the safe path.</p>
<p> Grandiose plans of many dotcom companies failed horribly. Investors should be suspect of anyone who claims of unheard, unseen greatness. Those who want to change the world should be equally humble as their ambitions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lean and Flexible</p>
<p> Planning is being arrogant, startups should stay flexible and lean. Make incremental changes, experiment and align course accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve on competition</p>
<p> Small startups should not try to create new markets from the ground up, instead focus on making improvements on established markets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Product is more important than sales</p>
<p> Technology is more about product than sales, so focus on your product. If you product cant sell itself, it&#39;s not good enough. Dot com companies spent so much money on advertising, only viral effects are worth the money.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Right after listing the 4 learnings, Thiel plays devil&#39;s advocate and says <strong>entrepreurs and investors took the wrong learnings from the dot com bubble</strong>. Thiel&#39;s learnings are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is better to risk boldness than triviality.</li>
<li>A bad plan is better than no plan.</li>
<li>Competitive markets destroy profits.</li>
<li>Sales matter as much as product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously neither set of learnings are entirely right or wrong. Thiel wants the reader to think for themselves, reactions to past mistakes can be as wrong as the mistakes made. Stay pragmatic and don&#39;t be afraid of being labeled as contrarian.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3-all-happy-companies-are-different">Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different</h1>
<p>According to Thiel, one of the biggest economic lie we are told by the economists is the state of perfect competition which leads to market equilibrium.</p>
<p>The reality is, there is no perfect competition, competition eats away from the same pool of potential profits. In a market with perfect competition, nobody makes any money. Economists are eager to advocate market equilibrium not because it makes economical sense but it is easier to model.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider the case of Alphabet (Google). Don&#39;t be evil has become  company&#39;s motto. From the outset Alphabet is advocating responsible business ethics, which sounds great. However, it&#39;s made possible due to the fact that Google enjoys a monopoly in the internet search market. When was the last time you heard someone say let me Bing that? Google earns 78% of $48.7B US search ad revenues.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s move on to the teaching of this chapter, the difference between the mentality of a monopolist and a non-monopolist.</p>
<p>Non-monopolist exaggerate their uniqueness by describing their target market as the intersection of various smaller markets.</p>
<p>Imagine James who moved to Bay Area from London, and he wants to open a restaurant in Bay Area serving British food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bay Area ∩ Restaurants ∩ British Food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James is a non-monopolist. By defining his target market in the way he does, he ensures &quot;uniqueness&quot; but he doesn&#39;t ask the questions such as &quot;how many other restaurants are there in Bay Area&quot; to get a rational grip on the degree of competition.</p>
<p>In contrast, monopolist disguise their monopoly status by describing their target market as the union of large sectors.</p>
<p>Alphabet is an internet technology company, their target market is something like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet ∪ Software ∪ Mobile Phones ∪ Search Engines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4-ideology-of-competition">Chapter 4: Ideology of Competition</h1>
<p>It&#39;s not only the economists that are fooled by competition, our society is driven by it!</p>
<p>Bright students at a young age start competing for admissions to elite institutions.</p>
<p>Once they reach there, competition intensifies now the target is to land that management consulting, investment banking or blue-chip engineering position.</p>
<p>Once they land at those prestigious jobs, competition reaches new highs. Vicious circle continues until the intensity of competition reaches to a level that sucks life out of them. That&#39;s how the tale of fatalist badge-collecting conformist ends.</p>
<p>Lesson here is that, competition is WAR, and war is a costly business both in terms of time and resources. War should be avoided if it&#39;s not worth it. In the case that war is worth having, then you should strike hard and end it quickly. There are no half measures in war.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-5-last-mover-advantage">Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage</h1>
<p>Escaping competition is the first step to building a monopoly, but it should be defensible.</p>
<p>When evaluating fast-growing small companies ask this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will this business still be around a decade from now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characteristics of a Monopoly</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Proprietary Technology</p>
<p> This should be a significant improvement on top of what&#39;s available in the market today, a hard to replicate improvement by competitors. See Andy Grove&#39;s &quot;Only The Paranoid Survive&quot; for a further explanation of such changes, he calls them 10x changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Network Effects</p>
<p> As the number of users increase, it makes the product as a whole more valuable.</p>
<p> Social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn exploit this feature. As more people join the network, more valuable it becomes and further enhances the monopoly position.</p>
<p> Ironically, in order to leverage network effects you need to focus on a small target demographics &quot; a niche&quot;. Facebook started as a small experiment at Harvard, it didn&#39;t go worldwide from day 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Economies of Scale</p>
<p> Firms get stronger as sales grow because fixed costs can be spread over a larger quantity of sales.</p>
<p> Software is great industry to exploit this characteristic. The cost of serving the same software to another customer is nearly zero.</p>
<p> Service businesses are disadvantaged in this dimension by their nature.</p>
<p> Barber shops, yoga studios, consultancies can not tap into economies of scale as easily. Serving more customers means they need to open more shops in different locations and employ more people, which in return will increase fixed costs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Branding</p>
<p> Every company has a divine right to monopoly with their branding. A strong branding is a powerful way to obtain monopoly.</p>
<p> Apple is the pioneering example of this dimension. Their products, websites, shops are all designed with the same minimalist, slick, premium qualities.</p>
<p> Apple also maintains a strong control over all user touch points. This control ranges from physical to digital world, such as geniuses at Apple Stores to many checks done before an app is accepted to the App Store.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So how do you build a monopoly?</strong></p>
<p>Thiel advises startups to start with a small, well-defined target demographics which is clustered in a small geographical area.</p>
<p>It is easier to start with a small target audience rather than a large market. Large markets comes with cut-throat competition, remember what we said about competition in the last chapter?</p>
<p>Amazon started by selling books, then moved into DVDs and CDs before it became a store of everything.</p>
<p>Bezos timed move into adjacent and related markets perfectly to build Amazon to be where it is today.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not disrupt.</strong></p>
<p>Last piece of advice worth mentioning in this chapter is that AVOID DISRUPTING. Media is obsessed by disruptive technology, but most of the time disruptors get disrupted. Don&#39;t disrupt. If you intend to do so, well, do it in subtle ways. Disruption attracts the attention of competition as well as regulators. Last people you want to see or hear about.</p>
